Part3-2 cheats by using a built in background subtractor (talked to Ethan) He told me I should try some other approaches such as optical flow but never got the chance to really try. Also because of this, it really works poorly when it first starts (it learns).

Part3-3 does not use this, but sucks.

Did not get to more.

Part456 is just expirementing with claude to be honest, just including it because it kinda works

Video/pictures are in this repo
